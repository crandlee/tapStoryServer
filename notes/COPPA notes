   what they have access to and remove it / flag it if needed.  Possibly
   through a web portal

   new material or gain access to new material (through sharing, etc.)
-- Do some research on content checking of videos - audio scanning etc.

-- Significantly limit the amount of personal information entered by both
   the parent and child.
-- Keep readily available privacy policy online for easy perusal.
-- Make sure that all data associated with a child is available to the
   parent through an easy to get to portal.
-- Any way or verifying parent identity?
-- Non-electronic consent/removal of consent?
-- Make sure any consent/removal is saved to the system with history
   and timestamps.

   view resources outside of the client environment.
